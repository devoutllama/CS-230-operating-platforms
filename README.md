Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  Gaming Room is a company that intends to create a new version of an exisiting web-based game application - draw it or lose it, which will function on any other available platforms as opposed to its current version which     is android only. The game makes use of a repository of images. Each image being used as play progresses renders slowly within a time frame of 30 seconds to allow players to guess what the image is.
