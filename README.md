# CS-230-operating-platforms
-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  Gaming Room is a company that intends to create a new version of an exisiting web-based game application - draw it or lose it, which will function on any other available platforms as opposed to its current version which     is android only. The game makes use of a repository of images. Each image being used as play progresses renders slowly within a time frame of 30 seconds to allow players to guess what the image is.

-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  In the design template document, there is a section for evaluation of the operating systems being considered. In this section, I went in-depth on the OS's making sure to point out things that made each one stand out and     how compatible they were or weren't with the other software. I did place a huge emphasis on community solutions and maintenance for each OS.

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Working through and examining the UML diagram helped me understand how various pieces of code would come together and rely on each other. It also specified the main operating systems we were going to be working with for     the client. But above that, not much else. 

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  In the project milestone, we had begun working on the code for the project, there were several areas I was meant to improve on, it is safe to say I submitted starter code instead of what was actually asked for. However, I   will remedy this as I revisit the files. The specific changes being made will be on the singleton and iterator patterns, and their purposes. This will make my code function properly.

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I did my best to follow the specifications laid out for me. Whilst some of it did not come out as I expected, due in large part to the starter code, I didn't try to do anything fancy. When designing software for another     party, sticking to the rules they set out is best. In doing something they didn't ask for, the software or program might bring up unneeded problems, thus leading to broken trust between the developer and client. The only    time when such a thing is permissible is when both parties have addressed issues surrounding questions raised by the developer and agree on the solution being levied for.

-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  As mentioned before, I did my best to follow the specifications set out. In doing this I made sure that little was left to chance. In the future, in the advent of confusion around a subject or topic within development, I    will do my best to ask clarifying questions and conduct research accordingly.
